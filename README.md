Introduction
  An alarm clock for the average person who has trouble waking up. By implementing a bomb defuse game to our alarm clock, it will allow users to interact with our application in a fast paced and critical thinking environment. The bomb defuse game consist of different colored wires and a set of instructions. By completing the instructions it will shut off the alarm. There is a countdown for the alarm. As the countdown reaches closer to zero the alarm sound will increase. If the countdown reaches zero, a new bomb defuse game will activate. The occurrence will repeat until the user as successfully defused the bomb.
